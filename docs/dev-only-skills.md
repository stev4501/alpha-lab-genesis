# Developer-only skills

How third-party Claude Code skills are made available to humans working in this
repository without ever becoming available to the autonomous research sessions
launched by `loop/run_session.sh`.

## The requirement

Third-party skill collections are useful during supervised development. They are
actively harmful on the autonomous path. Several skills in the currently
vendored collection (`implement`, `prototype`, `research`, `to-tickets`,
`wizard`) instruct an agent to scope new work and build it self-directedly,
which is the precise opposite of the mandate in `loop/prompts/session.md`:

> Do NOT start new strategy experiments, register hypotheses, or touch holdout
> data — the current phase is loop-proving maintenance only.
> [...] One unit of work per session.

So the requirement is not "prefer that the loop agent ignore these." It is that
the loop agent must not see them at all — not their bodies, and not their
descriptions.

## Where Claude Code finds skills

Claude Code discovers skills from exactly these locations:

| Level | Path | Loaded when |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Personal | `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Always, all projects |
| Project | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Always, this project |
| Nested project | `<subdir>/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | When Claude reads or edits a file under `<subdir>` |
| Additional dir | `<added-dir>/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | When passed via `--add-dir` |
| Plugin | `<plugin>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Where the plugin is enabled |

Two consequences matter here.

First, this repository's nine core skills live at **`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`** —
repo root, not under `.claude/`. That is not a discovery path. The core skills
are never registered as Claude Code skills at all; sessions read them with the
`Read` tool, as `loop/prompts/session.md` directs. **This repository therefore
makes no use of the `Skill` tool.**

Second, `.claude/skills/` would be the wrong home for vendored skills, because
project skills load into *every* session in the repository, `claude -p`
included.

## The arrangement

The plugin is vendored at `dev/plugins/mattpocock-skills/`, which is not a
discovery path at any level. It is loaded per-session with an explicit flag:

```bash
bin/dev-session          # == claude --plugin-dir dev/plugins/mattpocock-skills
```

`loop/run_session.sh` passes no `--plugin-dir`, so autonomous sessions load
nothing. Plugin skills are namespaced — `/mattpocock-skills:tdd` — so they
cannot shadow a core skill or the bundled `/code-review`.

The one thing that would break this is adding the plugin to `enabledPlugins` in
`.claude/settings.json`. That makes it load for every session, including
autonomous ones. `tests/test_dev_plugins.py` asserts this does not happen.

## Why the runner's `--allowedTools` is not sufficient on its own

`loop/run_session.sh` passes an `--allowedTools` list that does not name
`Skill`. That is worth being precise about, because the reasoning recorded in
`backlog/BL-0006-scope-agent-deny-rules.md` leans on this flag:

> `run_session.sh` passes an `--allowedTools` **allowlist**, and `git push` is
> not in it, so the unattended agent cannot push regardless of what this file
> says.

That conclusion is correct for `git push`, but for a reason narrower than
"allowlist." Per the Claude Code CLI reference, `--allowedTools` is an
**auto-approve list, not a restricting allowlist** — "tools that execute without
prompting for permission [...] To restrict which tools are available, use
`--tools` instead."

Tools omitted from it remain available and fall back to prompting. On the
autonomous path there is nobody to prompt, so a *permission-gated* tool is
effectively denied — which is why the `Bash`/`Edit`/`Write` reasoning in BL-0006
holds.

The `Skill` tool is not permission-gated. Claude invokes skills without a
permission prompt. So omitting `Skill` from `--allowedTools` does **not** keep
skills away from an autonomous session; if a skill were discoverable, the agent
could invoke it, and its description would sit in the agent's context either
way.

This is a gap in a layer, not an active hole: nothing is discoverable today, and
the arrangement above keeps it that way. But it means the guarantee currently
rests on a flag being absent from one script rather than on an enforced control.

## The recommended backstop

Add `--disallowedTools "Skill"` to the `claude -p` invocation in
`loop/run_session.sh`. A bare tool name in `--disallowedTools` *removes the tool
from Claude's context* outright, rather than denying matching calls.

Because this repository makes no use of the `Skill` tool on the autonomous path
(see above), this costs the loop nothing and converts the guarantee from
"the loop was not handed the flag" into "the loop structurally cannot run a
skill" — including one that someone later drops into `.claude/skills/` by
mistake.

`loop/` is a protected path, so this change is applied by a human. The patch is
in `core_change_requests/2026-08-08-loop-skill-backstop.md`.

## Adding another developer-only plugin

1. Vendor it under `dev/plugins/<name>/` with a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
2. Record provenance in `dev/plugins/<name>/VENDOR.md` — upstream URL, commit
   SHA, version, license, date.
3. Add the path to `PLUGIN_DIRS` in `bin/dev-session`.
4. Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests`.

Review what you vendor. A plugin can ship hooks, MCP servers, and skills that
declare `allowed-tools` to grant themselves tool access without prompting. The
currently vendored collection ships none of those; `tests/test_dev_plugins.py`
checks that this stays true.
